        <p>
          Having lived in different countries with very different cultures,
          plus my journey through the marketing and publicity world,
          I’m sure I can add a valuable point of view to the projects I’ll work on.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve got versatile experience from working in well established corporate
          companies as well as in fast-paced start-up environments as Frontend Developer (Full-Remote and hybrid).
        </p>
    
        <p>
          On the social side, I’ll be quick to integrate into a new team,
          making sure that everyone feels supported and starts
          their day with a smile (if I can help it). 
        </p>

        <p>
          I see myself in the future developing a great professional path
          amongst super talented people and getting knowledge about
          backend development is on my To-Do list.
